## mail.txt File Format

The mail.txt file should include a list of email addresses along with their corresponding SMTP keys. Each entry must be formatted correctly to ensure proper functionality.

Format:

Each line should represent a single entry.

The format for each entry should be: email:smtp_key


## Example:

example1@example.com:smtp_key_1
example2@example.com:smtp_key_2
example3@example.com:smtp_key_3

## Guidelines:

Ensure that there are no extra spaces before or after the entries.

Each email and its corresponding SMTP key must be on its own line.

This format allows the tool to read and process the email and SMTP key pairs accurately.
